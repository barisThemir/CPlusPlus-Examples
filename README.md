# C++ Examples 🚀

I collect the exercises, algorithms, and sample projects I've done while learning the C++ programming language in this repository.

## 📂 Contents

Current projects:

* **BankAtm:** A simple console application that performs balance inquiries, deposits, and withdrawals.

*(I will add to this list as I create new examples.)*

## ⚙️ How to Run It?

You can use any C++ compiler (GCC, Visual Studio, Dev-C++, etc.) to run the code on your computer.

If you want to compile it via the terminal:

```bash
g++ filename.cpp -o application
./application
